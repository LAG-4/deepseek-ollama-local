# AI-Coding Assistant with Streamlit, LangChain and DeepSeekAI  
## Introduction   
This assistant uses the latest cutting edge technology to assist developers by providing real time pair 
programming assistance. It integrates streamlits functionality through Python's web framework into a language 
model that provides natural language understanding based on data science concepts used in AI research like 
Chain of Responsibility, Command and State patterns etc., which then passes it onto LangChain for complex 
chaining operations or the deepseekAI to provide debugging capabilities. 
## Features   
The project utilizes Streamlit's simplicity & speed efficiency while also leveraging DeepSeek’ AI model that 
is trained on a large dataset of coding questions and provides real-time pair programming assistance, with 
language understanding based upon data science concepts used in research like Chain Of Responsibility (CoR), 
Command Pattern(Command) or State pattern. It uses LangChain's capability to process complex user commands 
into actionable problems that can be solved by AI algorithms thereby providing fast and efficient debugging 
capabilities for the developer teams across multiple platforms such as Python, JavaScript etc., using 
Streamlit’s speed & ease of use in a way no other tool could achieve
## Installation   
You must have streamlit installed on your python environment. If not you can install it via pip:  ```pip 
install streamlit ```  And the necessary packages for LangChain and DeepSeek AI model are also required to be 
added into Python Environment in such a way that they're available at runtime, You could use requirements file 
while installing if there is any requirement other than simple Streamlite or Dependency.
Download the DeepSeek project from ollama to use it on this application at the port http://localhost:11434
## Usage   
To start this assistant you simply need the python script for it installed and run from your command line:  
```python filename.py ```  In case of running directly via streamlit, open a new terminal in that directory 
then type :  `streamlit run app.py` , where "app" is name provided while creating 'Stream App'.
## Technologies Used   
The technologies used here include Python for the codebase and Streamlite as UI library; LangChain to process 
complex user commands into actionable problems, DeepSeekAI model's training data will be utilized.
