{"content":"<think>\nOkay, so the user provided some code and wants me to help them fix it. Let me look at what they have.\n\nThey initialized an AI model using ChatOllama, setting the selected_model variable. Then, they created an output_parser instance with StrOutputParser(). Next, there's a user_input text input that shows up when something is entered. Inside that if statement, they're using st.spinner to show loading and then invoking the model with user_input.\n\nWait, I remember that ChatOllama has been updated. Previously, you might have used ai_model.run(), but now it probably uses .invoke() instead. So that's why the user got a fixed message: .run() isn't supported anymore.\n\nSo, first step is to change ai_model.invoke(user_input) from run(). That should fix the error they're seeing.\n\nAlso, I notice they have output_parser but aren't using it yet. Maybe they intended to parse the response before sending it back or displaying it. So adding a line like parsed_response = output_parser.parse(response) would make sense here.\n\nThen, they should update the display message from \"AI Response\" to something more accurate, like \"Parsed Response,\" so it's clear what's happening.\n\nPutting it all together: replace .run() with .invoke(), add the parsing step, and adjust the message. That should make everything work smoothly.\n</think>\n\nBased on your code snippet, you're using the ChatOllama AI model to process a user query through a Streamlit interface. However, there are some potential improvements we can make:\n\n1. **Using `ai_model.invoke()`**: The code uses `.invoke()`, which is the correct method for interacting with the ChatOllama model according to the latest API documentation.\n\n2. **Adding Output Parsing**: You have an `output_parser` set up but it's not being used in the current code. This should be incorporated into the response processing flow.\n\n3. **Improving Message Labels**: The output message label could be more descriptive.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code with these improvements:\n\n```python\n# Initialize AI Model\nai_model = ChatOllama(model=selected_model)\noutput_parser = StrOutputParser()\n\n# User Input Field\nuser_input = st.text_input(\"Enter your query:\")\n\nif user_input:\n    # Using .invoke() instead of the previous run() method\n    with st.spinner(\"Generating response...\"):\n        response = ai_model.invoke(user_input)\n    \n    st.write(\"### Parsed Response\")\n    parsed_response = output_parser.parse(response)\n    st.write(parsed_response)\n```\n\nThis updated code:\n- Uses `.invoke()` as per current ChatOllama API requirements\n- Adds the parsing step using your existing `output_parser`\n- Changes the message label to something more descriptive","additional_kwargs":{},"response_metadata":{"model":"deepseek-r1","created_at":"2025-02-05T13:50:52.831738673Z","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","total_duration":293122507056,"load_duration":75943335522,"prompt_eval_count":93,"prompt_eval_duration":15895000000,"eval_count":574,"eval_duration":201282000000,"message":"Message(role='assistant', content='', images=None, tool_calls=None)"},"type":"ai","name":null,"id":"run-f9f04759-2df5-4607-a977-b5a9ccfe5835-0","example":false,"tool_calls":[],"invalid_tool_calls":[],"usage_metadata":{"input_tokens":93,"output_tokens":574,"total_tokens":667}}
